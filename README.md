# Small_World

My advanced C++ project for a winter semester. It's my first dive into C++ and I'm pretty glad it's over. This is a text based version of the game "Small World". I use the following design patterns: Strategy, observer, and MVC. I'm thinking of learning how to use OpenGL or SDL2 to make a GUI for this when I want to improve this. For now, it'll sit in my repo :)
